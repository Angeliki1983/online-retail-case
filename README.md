First, download the dataset Online Retail and put it in the same directory as the iPython Notebooks. <br>
Second, start by the EDA notebook which is an exploration of the data.
Then, Market Basket Analysis to study customers purchases.
Finally, Customer Segmentation to help us divide them into groups and know how to target them based on the segments.

Perspectives:
- Classification of customers

-Clustering of transaction dataset based on its initial features (CustomersID, InvoiceDate,etc), apply PCA, feature selection.

-Create new features (Time, Day of week, Month) to explore the data (EDA) from that point and see what common behaviors like in which period they shop most etc.
